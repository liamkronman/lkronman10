@app.route(“/auth”, methods=[‘GET’, ‘POST’]) is not the same as @app.route(“/auth”)
When using @app.route(“/auth”, methods=[‘GET’, ‘POST’]), there are two scenarios:
1. Accessing the /auth branch directly through the query line would be a GET request
2. Accessing the /auth branch through submission can be POST or GET request (whichever you specify)


The key difference between GET and POST is that GET displays the queries in the query line while POST does not.


Request.headers contains information on the website and the user
