JSON stands for Javascript Standard Object Notation
starts and ends with curly braces
separate key and value with colon
separate key value pair with comma
keys must be surrounded by ""
keys are also fields
JSON is friendly readable familiar, but text based, space consuming, limited
BSON is Binary JSON
BSON bridges the gap between representation and JSON, for speed, space flexibility, and high performance
both has UFT-8 encoding, basic data support, but BSON supports more types of data
stores data in BSON, internally and over network, but can store and retrieve JSON
export in BSON unless u need to be able to read it later, otherwise JSON
mongodump --uri "<Atlas Cluster URI>"
exports in BSON
mongoexport --uri "<atlas cluster uri>"
            --collection="<collection name>"
	    --out=<filename>.json
exports in JSON
URI is Uniform Resource Identifier, basically the link used to connect
srv establishes a secure connection between an application and a MongoDB instance, following that should be username;password
All srvs are URIs, but not all URIs are srvs (srv more specific, URI more general)
atlas cluster uris are an example of an srv
mongorestore --uri
             --drop dump
imports data in BSON dump
mongoimport --uri
	    --drop=<filename>.json
imports in JSON
can also include --collection <collection name> to specify name of the collection the JSON will be saved to.
namespace is the database name and collection name combined
you can use key-value pairs to narrow the search results (can use multiple)
db.trips.find({"birth year": 1961, "start station name": Howard St & Centre St})
.find() searches for documents containing the arguments which are key-value pairs
.count() returns the number of documents that are in a set of documents
.pretty() prints the documents in a readable format
show dbs - equivalent to ls in bash shell terminal, shows a list of databases in a cluster
use <database name> - equivalent to cd in bash shell, enters into a database in that directory
it iterates through query results
cursor is a pointer to a set of querys
pointer is the address of that particular document
