2020-10-28

database - structure way to store data
nosql database - not in rows and columns
mongodb databse stores data as documents
documents are stored in collections of documents
a document in this case is is a set of field value pairs, kinda like dictionaries
atlas is a fully managed data base with mongodb at its core
clusters are servers that store data 
replica set - basically backups
instances are machines running software on the cloud or locally.
single clusters are configured as a replica set
free cluster gives 3 server replica set and 512 mb storage
connect with 0.0.0.0 allows ip access from every ip address
