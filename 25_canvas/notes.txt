K25 -- Implementing responsive rectangle and circle drawing in canvas element using JS
2021-05-05

clickdraw.html
- assign id to canvas
- link js below elements

clickdraw.js
- document when calling the entire page
- c (defined as the canvas element) when doing stuff to canvas
- ctx (defined as the 2d context of c)
- mode (state variable, rect vs dot)
- toggleMode, when called, just swaps between the two modes
- make sure to call beginPath first!!!
- stroke is what actually draws the thing, stuff before = "instructions"
- rect: x, y, width, height
- arc: x, y, radius, start angle, end angle, (and optional direction)
- calling clearRect with canvas width and height to wipe the canvas
- event listeners:
    - draw on mousedown
    - toggleMode on click of toggle-btn
    - wipeCanvas on click of clear-btn
