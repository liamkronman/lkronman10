K19 -- A RESTful Journey Skyward/Use urllib to request and recieve data from a restful api
2021-4-5

- We used urllib.request.urlopen to send an HTTP request to the NASA RESTful API.
    - Our HTTP request method worked as anticipated: the text recieved was the same as the text on the api website
- We had trouble parsing the data into a python dictionary, as it was returning bytes.
- We then used the “json” library to convert data from bytes to python dictionary.
- We finally parsed key_nasa.txt and concatatenated to the rest of url line.
